## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

Run the application with:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## App Structure

`app.py` is organised into the following functions:

- `run_pipeline()` — fetches and processes data sequentially with progress spinners
- `data_is_ready()` — checks whether processed CSV files exist
- `clear_data()` — deletes raw and processed files to force a fresh pipeline run
- `load_measurements()` — loads `measurements.csv` into a DataFrame
- `load_stations()` — loads `stations.csv` into a DataFrame
- `render_sidebar()` — renders navigation and data management controls, returns selected page
- `render_page()` — routes to the correct page renderer based on sidebar selection
- `main()` — entry point, runs pipeline if data is missing then renders the app

On first launch, if processed data is not found, the pipeline runs automatically.
Use the **🔄 Refresh data** button in the sidebar to re-fetch and reprocess at any time.

## Testing

Run the full test suite from the project root:
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

The test suite covers four areas:

**Data Pipeline** — `tests/test_data_pipeline.py`
- Checks that `stations.csv` is created after processing
- Validates all required columns are present
- Confirms the file contains data

**Data Quality** — `tests/test_data_quality.py`
- Validates borough names are Camden, Greenwich, or Tower Hamlets only
- Validates pollutant codes are within the known set (NO₂, PM2.5, PM10, O₃, SO₂, CO)
- Confirms all measurement dates can be parsed correctly

**Analysis** — `tests/test_analysis.py`
- Confirms WHO guideline thresholds are correct
- Validates peak value calculations
- Confirms missing data rate is within a valid range

**API** — `tests/test_api.py`
- Checks the LondonAir LAQN API species endpoint is reachable
- Checks the monitoring sites endpoint is reachable
- Confirms the API returns a valid JSON response

> Note: run the app at least once to fetch and process the data before running the pipeline and data quality tests.

## Data Collection

Air quality data is collected from the LondonAir (LAQN) API.

Script used:
```bash
src/processing/fetch_air_quality_data.py
```

The script:

- retrieves monitoring site metadata
- retrieves pollutant species information
- fetches pollutant measurements for the **date range selected in the sidebar**
- filters results for the following boroughs:
  - Camden
  - Greenwich
  - Tower Hamlets

The raw dataset is stored in:
```bash
data/raw/air_quality_3_days.json
```

## Data Processing

The raw JSON dataset is transformed into structured datasets for analysis and visualisation.

Script used:
```bash
src/processing/process_air_quality_data.py
```

This script generates two datasets.

### Stations dataset
```bash
data/processed/stations.csv
```

Contains:

- borough
- station name
- station code
- site type
- latitude
- longitude

### Measurements dataset
```bash
data/processed/measurements.csv
```

Contains:

- borough
- station name
- station code
- pollutant code
- pollutant name
- measurement date
- value

## Data Source

Air quality data is retrieved from the LondonAir / LAQN API:
```bash
https://api.erg.ic.ac.uk/AirQuality
```

The dataset contains monitoring station measurements for:

- Camden
- Greenwich
- Tower Hamlets

## Borough Boundary Data

The polygon boundary data was obtained from **MapIt by mySociety**.

Source:
```bash
https://mapit.mysociety.org/area/2493.html
```

Boundary polygons stored as GeoJSON files:
```bash
data/geo/camden.json
data/geo/greenwich.json
data/geo/tower_hamlets.json
```

These files contain the geographic coordinates used to render borough shapes on the interactive map using **Folium**.
